                    In today’s digital age, educational institutions embrace technology to enhance the student
                    experience and streamline administrative processes. At the heart of this transformation lies the
                    student portal, a web-based platform that serves as a one-stop destination for students to access
                    academic information, resources, and services. From viewing grades and course schedules to engaging
                    with professors and fellow students, these portals have become essential tools for modern education.
                    In this blog, we’ll dive deeper into what a student portal is, explore the key features and
                    functionalities to consider when building one, and highlight why platforms like Knack are the ideal
                    choice for creating a customized and efficient student portal tailored to your institution’s needs.
